# Getting started

- The easiest way to run this is by using [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) with `main.ipynb`.

## Running locally

- To run it locally, you can follow the instruction [here](https://jupyter.org/install) to set up Jupyter Notebook.
- Once that's done, you should run `pip install matplotlib` to install the plot library.
- Then you can run the `main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
